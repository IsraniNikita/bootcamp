# System Map: Web Application Architecture

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the web applicationâ€™s architecture, including the major components, how they interact, and key constraints that must be considered.

The web application allows users to sign up, manage their profiles, and interact with various services through a responsive frontend and a secure backend.

## Key Components

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
- **Description**: The frontend is responsible for providing the user interface. It interacts with the backend to fetch and display data.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
- **Responsibilities**: User authentication, profile management, and dynamic page rendering.

### 2. Backend (Application Logic)
- **Description**: The backend processes requests from the frontend, communicates with the database, and returns appropriate responses.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Responsibilities**: User authentication, business logic processing, API endpoints for data exchange.

### 3. Database (Data Storage)
- **Description**: The database stores all the persistent data, such as user information, preferences, and logs.
- **Technologies**: MongoDB (NoSQL), Redis (for caching).
- **Responsibilities**: Storing user data, session management, and fast access to frequently used data.

### 4. Authentication Service
- **Description**: This service handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Technologies**: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Responsibilities**: Validating credentials, issuing access tokens, handling session expiration.

### 5. Email Service
- **Description**: This service is responsible for sending transactional emails, such as user registration confirmations and password reset links.
- **Technologies**: SendGrid, SMTP.
- **Responsibilities**: Sending email notifications to users for various actions.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration Flow**:
   - A user submits their details through the frontend.
   - The frontend sends the data to the backend via API requests.
   - The backend processes the data, stores it in the database, and sends a confirmation email using the Email Service.
   - The frontend receives a success message and directs the user to the login page.

2. **User Login Flow**:
   - A user enters their credentials on the frontend.
   - The frontend sends the credentials to the backend.
   - The backend authenticates the user via the Authentication Service.
   - If authentication is successful, a JWT token is sent back to the frontend.
   - The frontend stores the token and provides access to the application.

3. **Profile Update Flow**:
   - The user modifies their profile details in the frontend.
   - The frontend sends the updated information to the backend.
   - The backend updates the database with the new information.

## Key Constraints

- **Scalability**: The backend should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests from users. Load balancing and auto-scaling may be required.
- **Security**: All sensitive data, such as passwords and personal details, must be encrypted. Authentication must use secure tokens (JWT).
- **Performance**: The application should respond to user interactions within 2 seconds. Caching and efficient querying must be considered to ensure fast data retrieval.
- **Compliance**: The system must comply with GDPR for storing and processing user data.

## Component Overview Table
| Component      | Description                                               | Data Flow                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**   | The user interface that interacts with the user.          | Sends requests to the backend and displays data.                   |
| **Backend**    | Server-side logic and data processing.                    | Receives requests,processes them, and interacts with the database. |
| **Database**   | Stores and manages the application's data.                | Provides data to the backend upon request.                         |
| **API**        | Interface for communication between frontend and backend. | Routes requests from the frontend to the backend.                  |

## Conclusion
This document serves as a reference for understanding the architecture of the system, the roles of its components, and how they interact to deliver services to users. New developers or team members should be able to refer to this document to quickly understand the system design.
