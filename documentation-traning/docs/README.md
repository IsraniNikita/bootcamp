# OWASP Top 10 Learning Project

This repository contains a series of learning exercises and resources designed to explore and understand the **OWASP Top 10** web application security vulnerabilities. This project aims to help developers, security professionals, and learners better grasp these risks and implement mitigation strategies.

---

## Purpose

The **OWASP Top 10** is a list of the most critical security risks to web applications, maintained by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**. The goal of this learning project is to provide an educational resource to demonstrate how these vulnerabilities occur, how they can be exploited, and how to mitigate them.

By working through this project, learners will:
- Gain a deeper understanding of web application security risks.
- Learn common ways vulnerabilities are exploited.
- Understand and apply effective mitigation strategies.
- Improve their ability to secure web applications in real-world scenarios.

## Project Description

This project will cover the following **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**:
1. **Broken Access Control**
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
3. **Injection**
4. **Insecure Design**
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

Each topic will include:
- A detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
- Written examples of how it can be exploited.
- Mitigation strategies for securing applications.

## Installation Steps

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/owasp-top-10-learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd owasp-top-10-learning
    ```

3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable). Some exercises might require specific tools or frameworks. Please check the README within each vulnerabilityâ€™s directory for specific setup instructions.

4. Optionally, set up a local development environment or virtual machine to simulate real-world scenarios (if the project includes practical exercises).

## Usage Examples

This project will guide you through each OWASP Top 10 vulnerability with the following usage steps:

1. **Broken Access Control:** 
   - **Vulnerability Explanation:** Broken access control occurs when a user can access resources or perform actions outside of their intended access level.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - **Example:** Prevent users from accessing admin-only pages.

2. **Cryptographic Failures:**
   - **Vulnerability Explanation:** Cryptographic failures occur when sensitive data is exposed due to weak or improper encryption.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Use strong encryption algorithms like AES and implement proper key management.
   - **Example:** Ensure sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card information, is always encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS).

3. **Injection:**
   - **Vulnerability Explanation:** Injection flaws, such as SQL Injection, allow attackers to send untrusted data to an interpreter, causing unauthorized commands to be executed.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to sanitize user input.
   - **Example:** Avoid concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.

4. **Insecure Design:**
   - **Vulnerability Explanation:** Insecure design arises from poor system architecture that fails to address security requirements from the beginning.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Follow secure coding practices and design systems with security in mind.
   - **Example:** Conduct security reviews and threat modeling at every stage of application development.
