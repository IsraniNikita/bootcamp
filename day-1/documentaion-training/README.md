# 📘 Developer Documentation: Tools & Best Practices Training

This training aims to equip developers with the skills to create, maintain, and publish high-quality documentation. Effective documentation is crucial for clarifying design, onboarding teammates, and improving overall understanding of a system.

## 🎯 Expectations

By the end of this training, you will be able to:

-   ✍️ Write clear and purposeful documentation using Markdown.
-   📊 Communicate processes visually using sequence and block diagrams.
-   🏗️ Plan and explain system design and architecture.
-   🚀 Structure and publish documentation using MkDocs.
-   📝 Annotate and explain your code as a habit.
-   🧐 Evaluate your own documentation using objective criteria.

## ✏️ Markdown Essentials

Markdown is the foundation for much of developer documentation – it's lightweight, readable, and widely supported.

### Practice Tasks

-   **📝 Markdown Cheatsheet:** Create a guide with headings, links, lists, code blocks, tables, and images. The goal is for someone unfamiliar with Markdown to be able to write a README using your cheatsheet.
-   **📄 README Authoring:** Write a comprehensive README for a small project you've built, including its purpose, installation steps, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
-   **🗓️ Daily Log:** Maintain a daily document/journal within the repository tracking "What I learned" and "What confused me" to observe your learning progress.

## 🖼️ Visual Thinking Tools

Visuals can often convey information more effectively than text alone, especially for structure and flow.

### Mermaid.js

-   **🌊 Login Flow:** Create a sequence diagram for a login process using Mermaid syntax within a Markdown file. Ensure it includes the user, frontend, backend, and database, with labeled and ordered messages.

### Draw.io (diagrams.net)

-   **🧱 3-Tier Architecture:** Design a block diagram illustrating the main components of a web application (e.g., client, API, database) using Draw.io. Export it as an SVG or PNG and embed it in a Markdown document with clear labels and a modular layout.

### XMind

-   **🧠 Design Document Mind Map:** Before writing a design document, create a mind map using XMind outlining its key sections: problem, goals, non-goals, options, and risks.

## 🚀 MkDocs + Material Theme

MkDocs allows you to transform Markdown files into a polished, searchable website, especially when combined with the Material theme.

### Practice Tasks

-   **🛠️ MkDocs Setup:** Install MkDocs and the Material theme. Initialize a project with a `docs/` directory and a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. Verify that `mkdocs serve` starts a live preview and renders at least three pages.
-   **🗺️ Add Diagrams and Structure:** Enhance your MkDocs site by integrating Mermaid diagrams, setting up navigation in `mkdocs.yml`, and creating a landing page (`index.md`). Ensure that pages are linked in the navigation, diagrams render correctly, and the search functionality works.

## 🤝 Google Docs for Collaboration

Google Docs is useful for collaborative drafting and review before finalizing documentation in Markdown.

### Practice Tasks

-   **📝 Proposal Document:** Collaborate with a peer on a one-page feature proposal using Google Docs. Ensure peer review comments are addressed, and the document is either exported or converted to Markdown.

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Docs: README + `docs/` Folder

GitHub hosts your code, and it should also host clear documentation.

### Practice Tasks

-   **📦 Repo Setup:** Create a `README.md` file and a `docs/` folder with a basic guide in a repository. The goal is for another developer to be able to clone the repository and understand how to get started within 10 minutes.

---

## ➡️ Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are excellent for illustrating time-ordered interactions between different parts of a system.

### Practice Tasks

-   **🔄 System Interaction Flow:** Document a sign-up process that includes email verification using a sequence diagram. The diagram should clearly show actors, arrows indicating the flow of messages, and notation for synchronous/asynchronous communication.

---

## 🧱 Block Diagrams

Block diagrams provide a high-level structural overview of a system.

### Practice Tasks

-   **🏛️ Architecture Overview:** Use Draw.io to create a block diagram illustrating a simple 3-tier architecture (client, backend, database). Label all components and use arrows to show the direction of data flow. Export the diagram to the `docs/` folder.

---

## 📝 Design Documents

Design documents help in planning and communicating the approach to solving a problem before implementation.

### Practice Tasks

-   **📄 One-Pager Design Doc:** Write a one-page design document covering the problem you're addressing, your goals, what's out of scope (non-goals), different options considered, the chosen solution, and potential risks. A peer should be able to understand your plan and reasoning.

---

## 🗺️ Architecture Documentation

Architecture documentation serves as a stable reference for how a system is structured and how its components interact.

### Practice Tasks

-   **🗺️ System Map:** Create a Markdown page that explains the major components of a system, how data flows between them, and any key constraints. A new team member should be able to understand the system's basics from your documentation and any accompanying diagrams.

## ✨ Best Practices Summary

-   Keep documentation versioned alongside code.
-   Start documenting early and revise frequently.
-   Document before, during, and after coding.
-   Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what."
-   Use examples whenever possible over abstract definitions.
-   Combining diagrams with text enhances understanding.
